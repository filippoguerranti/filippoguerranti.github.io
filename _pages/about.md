Who am I?
======
I am a dynamic person, constantly looking for improvements.
Passionate about math, technology and everything related to the digital world.

I am currently attending the master's degree program in Computer and Automation Engineering at the University of Siena and I am dedicating myself with great passion to the study of the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I am interested in the applications that these disciplines will have in the present and in the near future within society, with a certainly not negligible impact: automation and robotics, medicine and medical research, digital innovation, finance and much more.

I love doing sports and reading a bit of everything: classics, science books, personal development and psychology.
In the free time I also write for Passaporto Futuro, which is a web-blog that aims at provide high quality news in order to contrast the fake-news and to build a better future in the field of information. You can read my articles (in italian) [here](https://filippoguerranti.github.io/articles/).

During the years I collected some notes about the courses in Computer Engineering (BSc) at the University of Siena, as well as the ones for Computer and Automation Engineering (MSc). The notes are "work-in-progress" and you can find some of them [here](https://filippoguerranti.github.io/publications/).
